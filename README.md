# Basic React App

This project fetches news from NewsAPI using React.js. 

## API Fetching

The apis folder contains one file which stores the base URL of the API to be fetched and the key for the API.

## On going work

Use NewsAPI’s sorting options to sort the article list by popularity.

Adding Previous and Next links to paginate through articles

Adding specific numeric pagination links to jump to a specific page

Display the article’s published date & time in a human readable format (Jan 1, 2018 12:00 PM)
